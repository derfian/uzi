       uzi INSTALLATION
===============================================================

Short and quick installation:

1.) tar pzxvf uzi<version>.tar.gz in your home dir. (or wanted dir)

2.) edit the <uzidirectory>/uzi file

3.) add to ~/.tfrc: /load uzi/uzi (or wanted)
    if you're new to tf, add this too: /load uzi/tiny.world
    quick: 
      echo "/load uzi/uzi" >> .tfrc
      echo "/load uzi/tiny.world" >> .tfrc

    if you want to know how a tiny.world file could look like, check
    http://mud.fobie.net/uzi/tiny.world

4.) run tf, connect to burning and make sure you have the following
    prompt on burning: %r%h(%H)H %p(%P)M %m(%M)V > %L, else, you just

    display %r%h(%H)H %p(%P)M %m(%M)V > %L

5.) when you've been connected to burning and the script looks loaded,
    run the /menu


  if you run into some problems using the /menu command, type /saveall
  in tf, open up a terminal and launch your favourite editor and edit
  all values by hand. (example: vi /path/to/uzi/saves/Orange.sav)
