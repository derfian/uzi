  This isn't much for a readme file actually :P
  If you run into problems, first check http://mud.fobie.net
  and if you still got problems with something, well mail us,
  uzi@fobie.net

  Bugzilla: http://uzi-tf.no-ip.org/

  The speedwalk.tf isn't written by anyone of us, it's written
  by Ken Keys(I think;>) , but I changed the speedwalk alittle
  bit, if you print news you won't go north,east,west,south,
  you will send it to the mud to get latest news ;)
